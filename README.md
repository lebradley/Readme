# _Product Developer AND Ukulele Player_

I joined AND in October 2017. I'm a Developer, recently mainly in JavaScript, although I have done a little Java, C# and Python before. Outside work I might be climbing, exploring London or playing frisbee in various exciting (Mallorca) and _less_ exciting (Burgess Hill) locations.

## Working patterns

I don’t think I’m a morning person. Sometimes, I try to get in earlier so I can clear some tasks before they get lost in the day.  

I enjoy pairing and mobbing on tickets and problems. I tend to set timers when doing so, to remind us to swap over and not accidentally 'take over' driving for the whole day. 

It’s important for me to separate work from the rest of life, and I want everyone else to have that balance too. If I send you a message outside of working hours, or accidentally on your day off, trust that I’m sending it before I forget and I don't intend any pressure on you to return it.

## Feedback

Written feedback is useful for me to look back on, and to use in reviews. If you prefer to give feedback in person, please allow me to ask questions as needed. I tend to give feedback in written form. However, I know that face to face is preferred; I’m working on this, and any help or advice would be always be welcome.
